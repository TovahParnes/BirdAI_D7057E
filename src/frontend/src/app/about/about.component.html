    <p>About us at BirdAI</p>
    <p>We are nine team members all studying the course <span style="font-style: italic;">Projekt i interaktiva system D7057E</span> at the Lule√• Tekniska Universitet. The app we are creating
        for this is BirdAI which the primary use of is as a tool for identifying birds with the help of AI. This however is not the only use we have envisioned
        for BirdAI as we hope to expand it into a larger social app for birdenthusiasts all around the world to interact with each other.
